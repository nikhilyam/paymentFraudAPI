# Payment Routing API

## Overview
Simulates routing of payment requests to Stripe or PayPal based on a fraud risk score.

### Features
- Fraud risk scoring with configurable heuristics
- Dynamic routing to payment provider
- Natural language explanation for decisions
- In-memory transaction logs with pino
- Input validation with Joi
- Environment variable validation via evalid

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/nikhilyam/paymentFraudAPI.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Setup environment variables in `.env`:
    ```
    APP_PORT=3000
    NODE_ENV=development
    OPENAI_API_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```
    npm start
    npm run dev
    npm test
    ```
5. Available Endpoints:
- `POST /charge` : Simulates a payment routing decision.
- `GET /transactions` : Retrieve all processed transactions.

## API Endpoints

### POST `/charge`
Simulates a payment routing decision.

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "source": "tok_test",
  "email": "donor@example.com"
}
```

### GET /transactions
Retrieve all processed transactions.

## Fraud Logic Description
- If amount >= 1000 → +0.3 score
- If email ends with .ru or test.com → +0.3 score
- Max score capped at 1

## Routing Decision:
- Score < 0.5 → routed to a random provider
- Score >= 0.5 → request is blocked

### LLM (OpenAI) Usage
After computing the numeric score, the service calls OpenAI API to generate a **natural language explanation** of the risk factors identified.

## Assumptions & Tradeoffs
- **In-memory state:** Tracks seen IPs and fingerprints in-memory. Not persistent across restarts.
- **LLM API cost:** Each evaluation calls the OpenAI API, which may incur usage costs.
- **Simple Heuristics:** This is not a comprehensive fraud detection engine, just a rule-based score combined with AI explanation.
- **Rate Limiting:** LLM requests use retry logic with backoff on 429 errors but lack advanced rate-limiting protections.

### Tech Stack
- Node.js with Express
- Joi for validation
- Axios for API calls
- dotenv + envalid for environment configs
- OpenAI GPT for explanations

## Testing

We use **Jest** and **supertest** for testing the API endpoints.

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Example Test Cases
Tests cover:
- `POST /charge` - should return risk score and status with success
- `POST /charge` - should block high risk payment
- `GET /transactions` - should return all transactions after charge

### Test Setup
Create a test file at `tests/api.test.js`
